            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A Certain North-Country-Man by name <hi>John Plugg,</hi> ſuppoſing himſelf to be a man of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent parts, reſolves to ſpend no more of his precious time in his own Country, but intends to ſee the Metropolis of <hi>England,</hi> (of which he had heard much fame) not doubting but that his ſuperabounding wit would make room for his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and as ſoon as he had got out of ſight of his Habitation, he ſuppoſeth himſelf to be a mighty Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller indeed, and after ſome time ſpent in this long and moſt dangerous Journey, he eſcapes ſafe to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> which place he thinks (if poſſible) is Heaven upon Earth, and thereupon ſwears he'll never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into his own Country more, and now he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which way he might diſpoſe of himſelf accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his merit, his bloud being enflamed for an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable employment and not willing to undervalue
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44121:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>his parts, he reſolves to turn Merchant, but when he underſtands that he muſt croſs the Sea or elſe could not be on that employment, ſwears he'll avoid drowning in the ſalt-waters, and unleſs he could ſayl and traffick on dry ground it's no trade for him, but afterwards meeting with a man of an excellent functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Trade a Pawn-broker (forſooth) now they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to diſcourſe the matter roundly, how, and which way a man of parts might advance himſelf. The Pawn-broker tells <hi>John Plugg</hi> that if he will take his advice, and give him but a ſmall ſumm of money (not exceeding twenty Pounds) he would make him free of the beſt Trade in <hi>London,</hi> and that he would put him into a way and make him underſtand the whole matter in a ſhort time: this fancy tickled <hi>John</hi>'s brayns till they itched again with deſire to begin the trade, well, they agree in the matter, and now <hi>John</hi> is no bawble to be play'd withall.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>John Plugg,</speaker>
               <p>Tell me what my trade muſt be, a Pawn-broker, a Pawn-broker, and what's that? you muſt tell me how I'ſt come to be Maſter of Arts in that Trade.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pawn.</speaker>
               <p>Well, have but a little patience and I'll make you to underſtand (if you'll be but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent) how to cheat both friend and foe, young and old, rich and poor, and that compleatly too, you muſt receive and reſett all manner of goods that are brought to you, and if they are worth five Pounds you muſt ſay that they are not worth forty ſhill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and that you will not lend above thirty on them, and if they do not believe you, then you muſt ſwear ſtoutly that what you have ſaid is true.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>John,</speaker>
               <p>I'ſt warrant you the firſt <hi>Northern</hi> Oath

               <speaker>Pawn.</speaker>
               <p>I confeſs it will be worſt with you at firſt, for after you have bin a little while at the Trade, you'll learn to ſay and ſwear any thing, for we of that Trade are as ready at it as a Vintners Boy is at filling a glaſs of Wine, and for every Pound which you lend out you muſt have ſixpence a Moneth which is thirty Pounds per <hi>annum,</hi> intereſt in the Hundred.</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pawn,</speaker>
               <p>No, this is but, the plain dealing part in our Trade, when you take in any Goods, you muſt have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for entring their names, and if they fetch them away the next day, you muſt be paid a moneths Intereſt.—But with what Goods muſt I deal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pawn,</speaker>
               <p>With all ſorts, both with Mens cloaths and Womens cloaths, with Bed and with Boulſter, with Pot and with Pan and every thing.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jobn,</speaker>
               <p>And may I not wear the cloathes when I have them in my keeping.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pawn,</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>John,</speaker>
               <p>That's well, then Iſt quickly have a new Sute, and I will tell you how I will wear them, I'll have a three cornered cap, and being that I am a wiſe man and a good Schollar, for I have learnt my horn-book over and over again, and for ought I know Iſt be taken for a Lord Judge, and I'll have a ledder Doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, a black Coat, a blue pair of Breeches and a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low pare of Stockings and who can tell what Trade I am on then, and I will have a pair of ruffles, and a great pair of ſleeves, and a Presbyterian band, and then if I ſhould meet with Old-Nick in a corner, he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44121:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>would never ſuſpect me to be a Pawn-broker; ſo now I am ready for my Shop, I am a compleat perſon without doubt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pawn,</speaker>
               <p>No. but hold, you have not half learnt your Trade yet.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>John.</speaker>
               <p>why, what's want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pawn,</speaker>
               <p>you muſt be of a ſtrong conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and whett your tongue well before you begin, that it may cut out a hundred double Oaths before it be taken off the edge, for you muſt ſwear with the Knight of the Poſt, lye with the petty fogging Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citor, and pretend with the quack Doctor.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>John,</speaker>
               <p>Theſe are hard words but iſt tell you what I can do, I can pretend as much honeſt as any man and perform as little, and I can ſwear a hundred oaths in half a quarter of an hour, and for lying let me alone.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Pawn,</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>John,</speaker>
               <p>but how'ſt I do for a Shop, that will be large enough? for a little Shop will not hold a large Conſcience, I mean ſuch a Conſcience as Pawn-brokers have, and this Trade will make it to retch like a leadder ſack when it is fill'd with good Ale, well Iſt be promoting the trade daily, and in a ſhort time I am ſhure to be Lord-Mayor, but pray you Mr. <hi>Broker</hi> may I not ſay and do what I will in my own Shop.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pawn,</speaker>
               <p>Yes I tell you you may ſay and do any thing what you pleaſe, for you cannot offend the Law, nor wrong your Conſcience in this Trade, for we obſerve neither.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>John,</speaker>
               <p>I believe you have told me the truth now, and for that very cauſe I doubt not but a bleſſing will lye at your Threſhold, if you can but open the door and let it in,— <stage>and now honeſt <hi>John</hi> begins his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44121:4"/>Trade he's ready to uncaſe every body that paſſeth by ſaying, <hi>what do you lack? will you pawn your doublet or your breeches?</hi> at laſt comes a Country-man whoſe name is <hi>Slaſh,</hi> with a ſute of cloathes to pawn, <hi>John</hi> fingers him into the Shop, and ſtrikes a bargain with him preſently, and no ſooner is <hi>ſlaſh</hi> gone out of the Shop, but <hi>John</hi> begins to unſheath, puts on <hi>ſlaſh</hi> his cloaths and views himſelf in a Looking-glaſs, and after he had admired himſelf, ſwears that the taylor was a rare workman without doubt or elſe he could never have made a ſute ſo fit for his body and never took meaſure of him, and now he drives on the trade brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but ſhortly after comes <hi>ſlaſh</hi> to redeem his cloaths, <hi>John</hi> ſays</stage>

            <sp>
               <p>Sir I have been very careful of your cloaths, inſomuch that they were never out of my ſight, nor day off my back ſince I had them, and therefore I hope you'll give me ſomething more then ordinary for my great care.—</p>

               <speaker>John,</speaker>
               <p>Your Lordſhip needs not queſtion me any further for I never could lie in my life, but to affirme my words to be true I will tell you, and I am ſure that my Trade will vouch for my honeſty, I am a Pawn-broker.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>but what ſay you did you wear this mans cloathes when they were in your keeping?</p>
            </sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>John,</speaker>
               <p>O no, and pleaſe your Lord Juſtice to let me ſpeak for my ſelf and Iſt come well enough off I warrand you, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip cannot trouble me that I am ſure of, for I can neither offend the Law nor my own Conſcience in this Trade, and I am made free (to get gains any way) by the act of palm brokers Parliament, and would your Lord Juſtice have me to rebel and break lawl and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms which have been ſo long kept and obſerved but beſides that <hi>ſlaſh</hi> wore my money, and why ſhould not I wear his cloaths: and now pray you my Lord Juſtice let me go about my buſineſs what have you to ſay to me now? I knew that I ſhould come of bravely at laſt,</p>
            </sp>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>John,</speaker>
               <p>Why what would your Lordſhip do with me if you might have your will?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Justice,</speaker>
               <p>Nay Sirra I will have my will and I'll ſend you to <hi>Bridewell,</hi>

               <p>And what's that and pleaſe your Lord? Juſtice, a place to whip and beat you. O no good my Lord Juſtice, do not ſend me there, for I do not love to be beaten, Good my Lord Juſtice all theſe rogues Broakers thither and let me
